Now complete the statements below for each level you wish to be marked. Replace all text in square brackets.

LEVEL ONE

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [Account]

This superclass is extended into at least two subclasses called [User, Admin]

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [User] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [myStocks, balance]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [myStocks is used to store the stocks bought by the user (lines: 36, 48, 57, 68, 70). Balance is used to store the amount of money the user has (lines: 34, 37, 49, 62)]

Subclass [User] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [save (lines: 18-31), print (lines: 46-69)]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [Command.java (line: 52), Main.java (lines: 36-47)]

Subclass 2.

Subclass [Admin] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [KEY]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [they key is used to give permission to another user to create an Admin account (line: 119))]

Subclass [Admin] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be at least one): [save (lines: 32-34) print (lines: 37-42)]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [Command.java (line: 52), Main.java (lines: 36-47)]


LEVEL TWO

Polymorphism consists of the use of the Substitution principle and Late Dynamic binding.

In my code, polymorphism is implemented in at least two placesâ€¦

Example 1.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [Main (line: 18)]. The name of the superclass used in this example is [Account] and the subclasses used are [User, Admin].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why this example of polymorphism is necessary in your code.]

Example 2.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class name and line number where substitution is used]. The name of the superclass used in this example is [name of superclass] and the subclasses used are [names of subclasses].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class name and line number].

[Explain briefly (no more than four sentences), why this example of polymorphism is necessary in your code.]
